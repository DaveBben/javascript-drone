# Fly a drone with Javascript
Here's a simple project on how to fly a drone using javascript. I am using the [tello](https://store.dji.com/product/tello?vid=38421) drone. I bought mine from my local Microcenter, but you can find them on Amazon as well.

## Get Started
You will need:
1. NodeJS
2. Tello drone

## Running this app
Do a `node app.js` to run the file. Input any one of the commands available from the [tello sdk](https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/tello/0228/Tello+SDK+Readme.pdf). You must connect your computer to your drone first. And you need to start by using the `command` command once you establish a connection.
